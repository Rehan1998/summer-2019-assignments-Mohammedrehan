    <h2> What is photography? </h2>
    
    <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography"> Photography</a> is all about capturng beautiful things in a way that makes them look perfect and attracting by a camera. If you have to start photography you need a camera and something to take caputure into it as a picture. I personally do not have a camera other than my iphone 7+ but in my phone there are modes given in camera and each mode has a unique effect and it helps me to click the image how I want to. You can turn on your camera on your  phone and then also turn on or off the flash depends on your preferance then make a correct stance to click pictures. I also use many apps that help me edit the photos  to make them prettier and you can use them if you like, all you need is to download those apps and run them on your phone. </p>

    <h3> Some additional tips.</h3>
    
    <p> When I want a perfect picture clicked I take more than pictures and also use an app to make it attractive. Do not use additonal flash when you are in sunlight or at a place which has light. Also, avoid shaking the camera, your picture can be completely ruined when you accidently shake the camera while taking a picture; hold the camera firmly. It is always a good choice to choose a simple background. To become an advanced photographer, you will need a good camera and lens to click the best shots. But to make my pictures the best I use photo editing apps. Here are the <a href="https://iphonephotographyschool.com/best-photo-editing-apps/"> top 10 photo editing apps </a>
